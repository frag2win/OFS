refactor: optimize cache management and improve test coverage to 88.67%

## Code Refinements & Bug Fixes

This release focuses on code quality improvements, bug fixes, and test coverage
enhancements without adding new features. All changes strengthen the existing
Phase 3 implementation.

### Critical Bug Fixes

**Checkout Ghost Files Issue**
- Fixed checkout not removing files that shouldn't exist at target commit
- Implemented `build_tree_state()` to reconstruct complete file tree
- Now correctly identifies and removes extraneous files from working directory

**Commit False Deletion Bug**  
- Fixed commit incorrectly marking unchanged files as "deleted"
- Changed `get_file_actions()` to compare against full parent tree state
- Eliminated data loss risk from incorrect deletion tracking

**Test Cache Pollution**
- Resolved intermittent test failures from global commit cache contamination
- Implemented strategic `clear_commit_cache()` calls in fixtures
- All 299 tests now pass consistently without cross-test interference

### Test Coverage Optimization

**Coverage increased from 78.41% to 88.67%** (+10.26%)
- Added 55 new test cases across all modules
- **299 tests total, all passing** (0 failures)

New test coverage areas:
- Exception handling edge cases
- Checkout advanced scenarios (tree state building)
- Repository integrity verification
- Reference manipulation (HEAD, detached state)
- Object store corruption detection
- CLI command routing and error handling
- Enhanced ignore pattern matching tests
- File size validation edge cases

**Coverage by module:**
- Core commits: 95%+
- Repository: 92%+
- Commands: 85-90%
- Utils: 90-100%
- CLI: 85%+

### Performance & Quality Improvements

**Windows Compatibility**
- Replaced Unicode symbols with ASCII for reliable console output:
  - ✓ → [OK], ✗ → [FAIL], ⚠️ → [WARNING]
- Fixed encoding issues on Windows terminals

**Cache Management**
- Identified and resolved cache hit/miss inconsistencies
- Optimized commit loading with proper cache invalidation
- Improved test isolation and reliability

**Code Quality**
- Enhanced atomic write operations
- Better error handling and propagation
- Improved `.ofsignore` pattern matching
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### Technical Details

**Cache Management Solution:**
The test suite experienced intermittent failures due to a shared global
commit cache. Tests creating commits with the same IDs would retrieve
cached commits from previous tests, causing incorrect assertions.

Solution: Aggressive cache clearing between operations:
```python
clear_commit_cache()  # Added to fixtures and between commits
```

**Tree State Reconstruction:**
Both bugs stemmed from incomplete state tracking. The fix ensures all
operations work with the complete file tree state at any commit by
traversing history from the beginning.

### Verification

- All integration tests passing
- Checkout workflow verified across multiple scenarios  
- Commit tracking validated with complex file histories
- Repository integrity checks operational
- Zero test flakiness
